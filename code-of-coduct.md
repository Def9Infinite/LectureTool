# Code of Conduct - OOPP Group 20
*Mihai Late»ô, Dragomir Drashkov, Mirko Boon, Nathan Klumpenaar, Yifei Lu*

## Communication
- Our internal main method of communicating is through a discord server. The communication with the TAs is done using Jitsi calls and Mattermost.
- We schedule our internal meetings by consensus.
- We meet internally at least once a week.
- We publish all of our notes in a dedicated discord channel so that everybody has access to them.
- We also assign roles by consensus.
- Everyone must respect each other.
- The only language we speak is English.
- Ideas are shared with everyone, so they can be discussed.
- We are expected to answer within ~12 hours to internal questions/messages (during the week).
- We need to be well-behaved during all the meetings (no bullying, harassing, intimidation and other non-constructive behaviours)
- When reaching a consensus is impossible, a majority vote will decide upon the matter.
- When someone is stuck, he will first post in a discord channel and ask the other members for help. If none of them manages to - solve the problem, we will go to the group TA or to the technical TAs, depending on the problem.
- We do not talk over somebody else, we speak one at a time, so that everybody has the opportunity to express their issues and ideas.
- The code of conduct (this document) can be changed by regular branch-merge-request flow.

## Assignments
- Open merge request for new feature at least 3 days before deadline.
- Merge requests should be accepted & merged into master at least 1 day before deadline.
- We will review (check) the assignment before handing it in.

## Coding
- At least two other people need to approve a merge request before it goes into master.
- All branches (and also commits and merge requests) need to have descriptive names and a related issue.
- A merge request can only be approved if it has proper Java doc comments, it is properly tested and it has the right coding style. Google Java Style Guide We will use this one at the beginning, but we will modify it to our needs based on a consensus if needed.
- A single feature will be enough to be done in one branch.
- We should merge the branches as soon as possible.
- We will split the tasks on a consensus and decide on what every branch should contain.
- At the beginning of the week we announce on a discord channel what we are going to work on in that week, so that the other members know what to expect from each other.
- At the start, while developing our basic structure (schemas, endpoints), we will have multiple members working on a single issue.
- As we are advancing in our project we will strive to have small, seperate issues which are done by a single member.
- All features should be made with accessibility for everyone in mind.

## Aspirations & Expectations
- We are aiming to get a 9 or higher for OOPP.
- We will work as much as is neccesary to finish our issues.
- We want to implement all 'must' and 'should' backlog features.
- Depending on our time, we would also like to implement at least some 'could' features.
